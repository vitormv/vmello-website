    biography:
      - md//Back in 2005, I've pieced together my first website about my favorite anime
        at the time. Fast forward to today, I've worked in a digital agency,
        a [food delivery app](https://www.foodpanda.com/),
        [a scale-up who wants to paint the world green](https://www.flix.com/),
        and a [start-up building a sustainable food system](https://choco.com).

      - md//Although I've been working as a **Full-Stack
        Software Engineer** for most of my career, lately the focus was more on
        the Frontend side of things, with Typescript and React.js. Sounds clich√©,
        but something about "seeing" the results of my work still brings me joy
        after all this time.
