title: Vitor Mello
subtitle: Experienced Full-Stack Engineer
summary:
  - I have 15+ years of experience as a Software Engineer, proficient in all facets of web applications,
    including backend, frontend, and even some management roles. However, I consistently find
    greater fulfillment through hands-on coding.

  - Currently I focus more on the frontend side, with strong skills in Typescript, React (Redux
    and Sagas), Node (NestJS & Next.js) and GraphQL.

  - "Fun fact: I coded my first website (about Dragon Ball Z) when I was a 14 years old."
