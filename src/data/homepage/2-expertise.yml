    title: React and Javascript
    description: >
      Writing scalable React apps is one of the things I like the most.
      Either creating Webpack tooling from scratch, or testing with Jest
      and Enzyme, or actually writing complex web apps that users will
      love: this is where I feel at home.

    title: PHP + MySQL (& Symfony)
    description: >
      Over nine years of experience developing server side code for
      E-commerce, food delivery platforms, integrating external
      payment APIs and travel websites have taught me how to make
      things fast and scalable, even under high traffic and load.

    title: CSS and HTML
    description: >
      I develop maintainable and reusable components that will make
      sense for others who will use it, and organize them into SASS
      code using concepts like SMACSS and BEM. No one should ever be
      afraid of touching CSS code.

    title: Test Driven Development
    description: >
      Test first, develop second. This helps me keep the architecture
      clean, avoid spaghetti code and prevent regression bugs. I
      believe tests should be an crucial part in any development cycle,
      and I even find it fun to write them.

      Cras ornare tristique elit lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
      consectetuer adipiscing elit. Phasellus hendrerit. Pellentesque

    title: Forró
    description: >
      Forró is the most famous Brazilian partner dance, with lots of
      arm figures, foot work and style, which became a (very) regular
      hobby for me. Since 2015, I have been teaching regular Forró
      classes in Humboldt University to hundreds of students each year.
