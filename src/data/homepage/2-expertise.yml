    title: React and Javascript
    description: >
      Writing scalable and fast React apps is one of the things I like
      the most, together with Redux, Reselect. Also know my way around
      Webpack/Babel, optimizing bundles to their smallest size, smart
      polyfilling, testing with Jest, Puppeteer and BrowserStack.

    title: PHP + MySQL (& Symfony)
    description: >
      Over 10 years of experience developing server side code for
      E-commerce, food delivery platforms, integrating external
      payment APIs and travel websites have taught me how to make
      things fast and scalable, even under high traffic and load.

    title: SASS and HTML
    description: >
      I develop maintainable and reusable components that will make
      sense for others who will use it, and organize them into CSS
      modules to make the scope contained and avoid side effects.
      No one should ever be afraid of touching CSS code.

    title: Test Driven Development
    description: >
      This helps me keep the architecture clean, avoid spaghetti
      code, prevent regression bugs and increase developer confidence.
      I believe tests should be an crucial part in any development
      cycle, and I find it fun to write both unit and UI (integration)
      tests.

    title: User Experience
    description: >
      When developing frontend code, I always like to put myself into
      the end-user's shoes, and ask "But does this make sense?". The UI
      and UX should be easy to understand, remove any friction and make
      people actually enjoy them.

    title: Forró
    description: >
      Forró is the most famous Brazilian partner dance, with lots of
      arm figures, foot work and style. I started dancing over 8 years
      ago and it became a (very) regular hobby for me. Since 2015, I
      have been teaching regular Forró classes in Humboldt University
      to hundreds of students each year.
