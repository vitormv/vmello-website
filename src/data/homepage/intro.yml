biography:
  - 
    Hi, my name is Vitor and I have been living in Berlin since 2013.
    I was born in Brazil and finished a Bachelor in Systems Analysis
    in 2009 and have been working as a Full Stack Software Engineer
    for most of my career. PHP, MySQL and Symfony have always been my
    best friends, along with HTML+CSS and React.js and Redux, which
    are also part of my daily routine.
  - 
    I am a fan of writing code that anyone can read and maintain,
    using an architecture that is scalable and maintainable for the
    future. Whether this means extracting things into a microservice,
    or refactoring old legacy code in a way they don&apos;t make
    people cry when opening the source code, I always make sure the
    code stays relevant and bug-free.
  -
    I love programming and feel very confortable with learning (and
    using!) new technologies and tools. In fact, being a noob at
    something and then quickly learning and mastering about it is
    something that keeps me very motivated at work.
