description: What I am all about
biography:
  - md//Hi, my name is Vitor and I have been working as a **Full-Stack
    Software Engineer for more than 10 years**. I am an expert in
    **Javascript (React.js) and PHP**, and also a bit of infrastructure
    with Kubernetes/Docker and AWS systems. I love to break down
    complex scenarios, simplify processes and create simple
    solutions that help both the company, and my fellow colleagues.

  - md//I believe coding is a team sport, thus learning to play along
    with and write code that others find easy and pleasant to work
    with, is a requirement. Continous attention to the scalability
    and readability of the codebase ensures things stay future-proof.

  - md//Oh, and I love learning new things too, and feel very
    confortable with adopting new technologies and tools (if it aligns
    with the business requirements of course). In fact, being a noob at
    something and then quickly learning and mastering about it is
    something that keeps me very motivated at work.
