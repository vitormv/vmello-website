summary: >
  I have 12+ years of experience as a Full Stack Engineer, with strong skills in typescript,
  React (Redux and Sagas), Node.js (Nest.js, Next.js and express) and responsive layouts.
  I've also done a lot of PHP and Symfony3 in the past, and have some knowledge of
  DevOps with Docker, AWS, Google Cloud and CI pipelines. I love to break down complex scenarios,
  simplify processes and create simple solutions that help both the company and my fellow
  colleagues.
