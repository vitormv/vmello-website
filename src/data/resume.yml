intro: >
  Hi, my name is Vitor and I have 10+ years of experience as a
  Full Stack Engineer. I have very strong skills in javascript,
  ReactJs + Redux and responsive layouts. On the backend side
  I'm also highly proficient in PHP, Symfony and have some
  knowledge of infrastructure with Kubernetes, Docker and AWS.
  I love to break down complex scenarios, simplify processes
  and create simple solutions that help both the company and
  my fellow colleagues.
